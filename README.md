# GatherBase

*GatherBase* is a modular and extensible framework to automate the discovery of diverse solutions, capturing them, and extracting their metadata.
This is useful to *gather* solutions and their metadata in order to build specific knowledge *base* variants.
For example, the framework is used to populate *DevOpsBase*, a DevOps knowledge base or metadatabase.
